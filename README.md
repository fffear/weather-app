# Weather App

This is a project completed as part of the Javascript curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

This project is a weather forecast site, where you can find out the weather forecast of a city around the world. The weather forecast data is obtained via the [Open Weather API](https://home.openweathermap.org). Background Image is obtained via the [Giphy API](https://giphy.com/).
